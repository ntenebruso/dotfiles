# Dotfiles

This is a collection of the dotfiles I use for my personal machines. Feel free to use for your own use. These files set up programs such as Sway, waybar, alacritty, neovim, and more.

## Installation

To use this repo, simply clone it to a folder in your home directory, then run the installation script which installs all necessary packages then symlinks the dotfiles:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/ntenebruso/dotfiles/tree/master ~/.dotfiles
cd .dotfiles
./scripts/install.sh
```
